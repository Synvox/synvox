> In my spare time I speak at meetups here in Lehi, Utah. Here are a couple of my favorite demos:
> 1. [A simple chat app](https://github.com/Synvox/remix-chat-sse)
     This small app showcases a simple design system built in tailwindcss and some clever use of named anchors to create a more intuitive mobile experience. The app also has some nice accessibility features.
> 2. [Todoable](https://github.com/Synvox/todoable)
     A zero dependency web framework built on Bun that makes heavy use of async generators. It's a fun demo of how to build a web framework from scratch.
> 3. [Not-remix](https://github.com/Synvox/not-remix)
     This is a small web framework that re-implements the core functionality of Remix, but using preact instead of react.
> 4. [Youtube Music Clone](https://github.com/Synvox/youtube-music-demo)
     This is a small demo of a youtube music clone that uses the youtube api to fetch music and play it in the browser, including a custom audio player and visualizer.

Although most of my work is not open source, I'm always happy to chat about my experiences and learnings. Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-allred/) or [Twitter](https://x.com/ryannallred).
