> In my spare time I speak at meetups here in Lehi, Utah. Here are a couple of my favorite demos:
> 1. [A simple chat app](https://github.com/Synvox/remix-chat-sse)
     This small app showcases a simple design system built in tailwindcss and some clever use of named anchors to create a more intuitive mobile experience. The app also has some nice accessibility features.
> 2. [Todoable](https://github.com/Synvox/todoable)
     A zero dependency web framework built on Bun that makes heavy use of async generators. It's a fun demo of how to build a web framework from scratch.
> 3. [Not-remix](https://github.com/Synvox/not-remix)
     This is a small web framework that re-implements the core functionality of Remix, but using preact instead of react.
> 4. [Youtube Music Clone](https://github.com/Synvox/youtube-music-demo)
     This is a small demo of a youtube music clone that uses the youtube api to fetch music and play it in the browser, including a custom audio player and visualizer.
     
 ## Projects
 I've worked on a variety of projects throughout my career. Here are a few of the highlights:
 1. [LeaderFactor](https://leaderfactor.app)
    LeaderFactor is the premere leadership training platform for enterprises. I've lead the development of leaderfactor.app from `git init` to where it is today.
 2. [1 of X](https://web.archive.org/web/20230327061512/https://1ofx.net/)
    1 of X was a side project to scratch an itch. I like generative art and ran a NFT marketplace on polygon during the post-covid crypto craze.
3. [Skipio](https://app.skipio.com)
  Skipio is a messaging platform for independent consultants and sales teams. I lead the frontend and mobile teams.
4. [I-Know Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/i-know/oobphcndhljfbmllppplinbdagpnfbjp?hl=en-US)
   My sophomore year of college, I wrote a browser extension to aggregate my assignments to one checklist with reminders. Turns out lots of people needed something similar and the project went viral. Students across the globe used this extension, including Yale, Harvard, BYU and many, many more.
5. [Mimic Social](https://www.stukent.com/higher-ed/mimic-social/)
   Mimic Social is the worlds first social media simulation for marketing students. Students create assets, manage inboxes, and promote campaigns in a simulated environment to test their understanding of social media marketing.
6. [Canvas Creator](https://web.archive.org/web/20120221014722/http://canvascreator.net/)
   Canvas Creator was my first big project. It was a small animation and game creator with a drag and drop interface.
